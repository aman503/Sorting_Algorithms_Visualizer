# Sorting_Algorithms_Visualizer

We often use various applications of sorting algorithms in programming functions. To let them understand more efficiently, we should know how things are done with a variable set. Sorting visualizer provides us an imitation of the actual process while executing a sorting algorithm. So in a nutshell

"Sorting visualizer is a simulator of various sorting algorithms."

Here we are visualizing sorting algorithms, using the matplotlib library.

Algorithms covererd in this project are : Selection, insertion, merge, quick, bubble, heap sort
